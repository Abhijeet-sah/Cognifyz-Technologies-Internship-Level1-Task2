# 🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis

# 📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a restaurant dataset. The goal is to gain insights into restaurant distributions across cities, cuisines, and countries, while also calculating important statistical measures for numerical attributes.

•Through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical exploration, this project highlights:

•Popular cuisines

•Top cities with the highest number of restaurants

•Distribution of restaurants by country

•Basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) of numerical columns

# 📊 Features & Analysis

Basic Statistical Measures

•Mean, Median, Standard Deviation of numerical columns (like ratings, votes, etc.).


# Categorical Variable Exploration

•Distribution of Country Code

•Distribution of City

•Distribution of Cuisines


# Top Categories

•Top 10 Cuisines with the highest number of restaurants

•Top 10 Cities with the most restaurants


# Visualizations

Bar charts for city and cuisine counts

Count plots for country distribution

Clean and future-proof plots (Seaborn ≥0.14)


# 🛠️ Tech Stack

•Python 🐍

•Pandas → Data cleaning & manipulation

•NumPy → Numerical operations

•Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization

•Jupyter Notebook → Interactive analysis

# ✅ Results & Insights

Most popular cuisines were identified (e.g., North Indian, Chinese, etc.).

Cities with the highest number of restaurants were found (e.g., New Delhi, Mumbai, etc.).

Country distribution revealed which countries have the largest restaurant presence in the dataset.

Statistical analysis highlighted average ratings and votes trends.


# 📌 Future Improvements

Add interactive visualizations using Plotly/Dash.

Perform correlation analysis between ratings, votes, and cuisines.

Build a predictive model for restaurant ratings.
