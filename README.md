🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a restaurant dataset. The goal is to gain insights into restaurant distributions across cities, cuisines, and countries, while also calculating important statistical measures for numerical attributes.

Through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical exploration, this project highlights:

Popular cuisines

Top cities with the highest number of restaurants

Distribution of restaurants by country

Basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) of numerical columns

📊 Features & Analysis

Basic Statistical Measures

Mean, Median, Standard Deviation of numerical columns (like ratings, votes, etc.).

Categorical Variable Exploration

Distribution of Country Code

Distribution of City

Distribution of Cuisines

Top Categories

Top 10 Cuisines with the highest number of restaurants

Top 10 Cities with the most restaurants

Visualizations

Bar charts for city and cuisine counts

Count plots for country distribution

Clean and future-proof plots (Seaborn ≥0.14)

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas → Data cleaning & manipulation

NumPy → Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook → Interactive analysis

✅ Results & Insights

Most popular cuisines were identified (e.g., North Indian, Chinese, etc.).

Cities with the highest number of restaurants were found (e.g., New Delhi, Mumbai, etc.).

Country distribution revealed which countries have the largest restaurant presence in the dataset.

Statistical analysis highlighted average ratings and votes trends.

📌 Future Improvements

Add interactive visualizations using Plotly/Dash.

Perform correlation analysis between ratings, votes, and cuisines.

Build a predictive model for restaurant ratings.
